# Web app environment
A boilerplate environment to develop modern JS applications. 

## Development
This environment use a separate server/client sides. Server with NodeJS and client with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and  [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). There are a branch call *react* where you can find a client side with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and some other react base libs.

### Run development 

Clone repository 
`git clone [GitHub - carcruz/webapp-env](https://github.com/carcruz/webapp-env.git)`

Go to repository  folder
`cd webapp-env`

*Server*
 
Install server dependencies
 `npm install`

The entry point of the server side is `/server.js`

*Client*

Go into client folder
`cd /client`

Install client dependencies
 `npm install`

:rocket: And thats it! Now you can edit the `/source` folder. The entry point is `index.js`
